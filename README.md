# Claude Code Development Environment

## Directory Structure
- `_active/` - Current projects (3-5 max)
- `_archive/` - Completed/paused projects by year
- `_sandbox/` - Experiments and prototypes
- `_shared/` - Reusable code across projects
- `tools/` - Development utilities
- `.claude/` - Global configuration (in home directory)

## Quick Commands
- `cdev` - Navigate to active projects
- `cactive` - Go to _active directory
- `csand` - Go to _sandbox directory
- `claude-dash` - View active projects dashboard
- `claude-new <name> <template>` - Create new project

## Daily Workflow
