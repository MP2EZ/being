## Frequently Asked Questions

### Account & Subscription

**How do I cancel my subscription?**

Subscriptions are managed through your app store:
- **iOS:** Settings > Apple ID > Subscriptions > Being
- **Android:** Play Store > Menu > Subscriptions > Being

**Can I get a refund?**

Refunds are handled by Apple or Google according to their policies. Visit your app store's support page to request a refund.

**How do I delete my account?**

Go to Settings > Privacy > Delete Account in the app. Your local data will be removed immediately. Cloud data (if enabled) will be deleted within 30 days.

### Data & Privacy

**Where is my data stored?**

By default, all your wellness data is stored locally on your device. If you enable cloud backup, encrypted data is also stored on our secure servers (Supabase, SOC 2 Type II certified).

**How do I export my data?**

Go to Settings > Privacy > Export Data in the app. You'll receive a JSON file containing all your check-ins, assessments, and journal entries.

**Do you sell my data?**

No. We never sell your personal information. See our [Do Not Sell](/do-not-sell) page for details.

### App Issues

**The app crashed. What should I do?**

1. Force close the app and reopen it
2. Check for updates in your app store
3. If the issue persists, email [support@being.fyi](mailto:support@being.fyi) with details about when the crash occurred

**I lost my data after reinstalling. Can you recover it?**

If you had cloud backup enabled, sign in with your account to restore your data. If you were using local-only storage, we cannot recover data after uninstalling—this is by design to protect your privacy.
