# The Five Core Principles of Stoic Mindfulness

This folder contains the heart of the Stoic Mindfulness framework—five integrated principles that combine Stoic philosophy with mindfulness practice.

## The Five Principles

1. **[Aware Presence](./01-aware-presence.md)** - Foundation of all practice
   - Present perception + Metacognitive space + Embodied awareness
   - *Be fully here now, observing thoughts as mental events, feeling what's in your body*

2. **[Radical Acceptance](./02-radical-acceptance.md)** - Working with what is
   - Amor fati + Non-resistance + Suffering = Pain × Resistance
   - *This is what's happening. What do I do from here?*

3. **[Sphere Sovereignty](./03-sphere-sovereignty.md)** - Dichotomy of Control [MOST CRITICAL]
   - What's in/out of control + Intention over outcome + Reserve clause
   - *Focus only on what you control: your character, choices, and responses*

4. **[Virtuous Response](./04-virtuous-response.md)** - Character over outcomes
   - Four cardinal virtues + Obstacles as opportunities + Negative visualization
   - *What does wisdom, courage, justice, or temperance require here?*

5. **[Interconnected Living](./05-interconnected-living.md)** - Common humanity
   - Relational presence + Cosmopolitan perspective + Contributing to common good
   - *Bring full presence to others; act for collective flourishing*
