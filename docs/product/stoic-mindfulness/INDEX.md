### 📚 Foundations
Understanding why and how Stoic Mindfulness works:

- **[01. Introduction: Why These Traditions Need Each Other](./foundation/01-introduction.md)**  
  *The problem with Stoicism alone, mindfulness alone, and their mutual completion*

- **[02. The Core Philosophy of Stoic Mindfulness](./foundation/02-core-philosophy.md)**  
  *The central integration: Aware Wisdom = Metacognitive Awareness × Philosophical Discernment*

- **[03. The Neuroscience of Integrated Practice](./foundation/03-neuroscience.md)**  
  *How contemplative practice reshapes the brain: DMN, attention networks, emotional regulation*

### 🎯 The Five Core Principles (Detailed)
The heart of Stoic Mindfulness practice:

- **[04. Principle 1: Aware Presence](./principles/01-aware-presence.md)**  
  *Present perception, metacognitive space, embodied awareness—the foundation of all practice*

- **[05. Principle 2: Radical Acceptance](./principles/02-radical-acceptance.md)**  
  *Working with what is: This is what's happening. What do I do from here?*

- **[06. Principle 3: Sphere Sovereignty](./principles/03-sphere-sovereignty.md)**  
  *The Stoic dichotomy of control: calibrating what's within vs beyond your power*

- **[07. Principle 4: Virtuous Response](./principles/04-virtuous-response.md)**  
  *Character over outcomes: wisdom, courage, justice, temperance*

- **[08. Principle 5: Interconnected Living](./principles/05-interconnected-living.md)**  
  *From individual to collective: relational presence and the cosmopolitan perspective*

### 🔄 Practice & Development
How to practice and track progress:

- **[09. Developmental Stages: From Beginner to Mastery](./practice/developmental-stages.md)**  
  *Four stages of development: Fragmented Practice → Effortful Integration → Fluid Responsiveness → Integrated Wisdom*

- **[10. Daily Practice Architecture](./practice/daily-architecture.md)**  
  *Morning foundation (10-20 min), mindful moments throughout the day, evening reflection (5-10 min), weekly/monthly integration*

### 🌍 Applications & Support
Context-specific guidance and troubleshooting:

- **[11. Domain-Specific Applications](./applications/domain-specific.md)**  
  *Working with chronic pain/illness, relationship conflict, career uncertainty, grief and loss*

- **[12. Troubleshooting Common Obstacles](./applications/troubleshooting.md)**  
  *"Can't do both," "disappears under pressure," "avoiding change," "more agitated," "emotionally cold"*

### 📊 Measurement & Resources
Tracking progress and further learning:

- **[13. Assessment and Progress Tracking](./operations/assessment.md)**  
  *11 development markers, formal self-assessment, adjusting practice based on assessment*

- **[14. Further Resources and Reading](./operations/resources.md)**  
  *Classical Stoic texts, contemporary philosophy, mindfulness/meditation, neuroscience, community support*

## The Five Questions Framework

Ask yourself these questions throughout each day to apply the five principles in real-time:

1. **Am I present and aware?** (Aware Presence)  
   *Notice when your mind has left the present moment and gently return*

2. **Am I accepting what is?** (Radical Acceptance)  
   *Distinguish between acceptance and resignation—accept reality, then respond wisely*

3. **Am I focused only on what I control?** (Sphere Sovereignty)  
   *Release what's beyond your power, focus on your choices and responses*

4. **Am I responding with virtue?** (Virtuous Response)  
   *Apply wisdom, courage, justice, temperance to your current challenge*

5. **Am I considering others and the common good?** (Interconnected Living)  
   *Expand your perspective beyond self-interest to include the wider community*

## For Developers & Product Team

### Philosopher Agent Integration
- **Primary Reference:** This INDEX.md file for navigation
- **Principle Validation:** Navigate to specific principle files in `principles/`
- **Practice Validation:** Reference `practice/daily-architecture.md` for check-in flows
- **Classical Sources:** See `operations/resources.md` for Marcus Aurelius, Epictetus, Seneca citations

### Implementation Guidelines
- **Principles must never be diluted** or simplified beyond recognition
- **Integration with MBCT** maintains philosophical integrity (see `foundation/02-core-philosophy.md`)
- **All Stoic content** requires Philosopher agent validation
- **Cross-references preserved** via markdown links throughout all files

### File Organization Strategy
- **Semantic paths:** `principles/sphere-sovereignty.md` (clear intent)
- **Category grouping:** Foundation, Principles, Practice, Applications, Operations
- **Glob patterns:** `principles/*.md` finds all five principles at once
- **Scalable:** Add new principles/practices without renumbering
