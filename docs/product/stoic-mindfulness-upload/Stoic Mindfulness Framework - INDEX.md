How to practice and track progress:

- **[09. Developmental Stages: From Beginner to Mastery](Developmental Stages)**  
  *Four stages of development: Fragmented Practice → Effortful Integration → Fluid Responsiveness → Integrated Wisdom*

- **[10. Daily Practice Architecture](Daily Practice Architecture)**

## The Five Questions Framework

Ask yourself these questions throughout each day to apply the five principles in real-time:

1. **Am I present and aware?** (Aware Presence)  
   *Notice when your mind has left the present moment and gently return*

2. **Am I accepting what is?** (Radical Acceptance)  
   *Distinguish between acceptance and resignation—accept reality, then respond wisely*

3. **Am I focused only on what I control?** (Sphere Sovereignty)  
   *Release what's beyond your power, focus on your choices and responses*

4. **Am I responding with virtue?** (Virtuous Response)  
   *Apply wisdom, courage, justice, temperance to your current challenge*

5. **Am I considering others and the common good?** (Interconnected Living)  
   *Expand your perspective beyond self-interest to include the wider community*
