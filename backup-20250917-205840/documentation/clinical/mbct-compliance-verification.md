## 🧘‍♀️ MBCT FRAMEWORK OVERVIEW

### Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy Foundation

#### Core MBCT Principles:
1. **Present-Moment Awareness**: Cultivating attention to current experience
2. **Non-Judgmental Observation**: Accepting thoughts and feelings without evaluation
3. **Cognitive Decentering**: Viewing thoughts as mental events, not facts
4. **Body-Based Awareness**: Grounding awareness in physical sensations
5. **Relapse Prevention**: Building skills to prevent depressive relapse
6. **Self-Compassion**: Developing kind, understanding relationship with self

#### Evidence Base:
- **Primary Research**: Segal, Z. V., Williams, J. M. G., & Teasdale, J. D. (2012). *Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy for Depression: A New Approach to Preventing Relapse*
- **Clinical Efficacy**: 43% reduction in relapse rates for recurrent depression (Ma & Teasdale, 2004)
- **Anxiety Applications**: Significant improvements in GAD and anxiety symptoms (Evans et al., 2008)
- **Neurobiological Evidence**: Changes in amygdala reactivity and prefrontal regulation (Hölzel et al., 2011)

### MBCT vs. Traditional Approaches

#### Distinctive Features:
- **Integration**: Combines mindfulness meditation with cognitive therapy insights
- **Process Focus**: Emphasizes relationship to thoughts rather than thought content
- **Prevention Model**: Designed for relapse prevention, not acute treatment
- **Group Format**: Originally developed for 8-week group programs
- **Secular Approach**: Mindfulness without religious or spiritual context

#### Digital Adaptation Considerations:
- **Self-Guided Practice**: Adapting group-based program for individual use
- **Micro-Practices**: Daily brief practices vs. weekly 2-hour sessions
- **Progressive Skill Building**: Systematic development of mindfulness capabilities
- **Crisis Safety**: Integration with mental health crisis detection and intervention
