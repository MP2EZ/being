## 📊 LIMITATIONS OF SELF-ASSESSMENT TOOLS

### PHQ-9 (Depression Screening) Limitations

**Clinical Context Required**: PHQ-9 scores provide screening information only and require clinical interpretation for diagnostic purposes.

#### Score Interpretation Warnings:
- **Minimal (0-4)**: Does not rule out depression in all individuals
- **Mild (5-9)**: May indicate subclinical symptoms requiring monitoring
- **Moderate (10-14)**: Suggests need for professional evaluation
- **Moderately Severe (15-19)**: Requires clinical assessment and intervention
- **Severe (20-27)**: Immediate professional evaluation strongly recommended

#### Important Limitations:
- **Not diagnostic**: Cannot diagnose Major Depressive Disorder
- **Context matters**: Life circumstances affect interpretation
- **Cultural factors**: May not accurately reflect depression in all cultural contexts
- **Comorbidity**: Other conditions can influence scores
- **Time sensitivity**: Scores can fluctuate rapidly

### GAD-7 (Anxiety Screening) Limitations

**Screening Tool Only**: GAD-7 identifies potential anxiety symptoms but cannot diagnose Generalized Anxiety Disorder or other anxiety conditions.

#### Score Interpretation Warnings:
- **Minimal (0-4)**: Normal range but does not exclude all anxiety disorders
- **Mild (5-9)**: May warrant monitoring and self-care strategies
- **Moderate (10-14)**: Professional consultation recommended
- **Severe (15-21)**: Clinical evaluation and intervention strongly recommended

#### Important Limitations:
- **Generalized focus**: May miss specific anxiety disorders (panic, social anxiety, PTSD)
- **Physical symptoms**: Medical conditions can mimic anxiety symptoms
- **Medication effects**: Some medications can influence anxiety scores
- **Acute stress**: Temporary stressors may elevate scores without indicating disorder

### Self-Report Bias Considerations:
- **Response bias**: Users may under-report or over-report symptoms
- **Social desirability**: Tendency to provide "acceptable" answers
- **Mood state influence**: Current mood affects historical symptom recall
- **Literacy requirements**: Assumes adequate reading comprehension
- **Digital divide**: May not be accessible to all populations
