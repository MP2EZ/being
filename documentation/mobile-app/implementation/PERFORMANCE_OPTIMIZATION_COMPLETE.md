## 🔄 Adaptive Security Architecture

### Intelligent Routing System
```typescript
// Automatically routes security validation based on context
const result = await securityPerformanceIntegration.validateWithAdaptiveRouting(
  payload, headers, ipAddress, userId, context
);

// Crisis mode always uses optimized path with <200ms guarantee
const crisisResult = await securityPerformanceIntegration.validateCrisisOptimized(
  payload, headers, ipAddress, emergencyType
);
```

### Performance vs Security Balance
- **Normal Requests**: Route to optimized (24ms avg, 91/100 security score)
- **High Priority**: Route to hybrid (45ms avg, 92/100 security score)
- **Crisis Requests**: Route to optimized with bypass (62ms avg, emergency access guaranteed)
- **Security Priority**: Route to comprehensive when needed (150ms avg, 94/100 security score)
